# EVM Mastery: The Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the GitHub repository for "EVM Mastery: The Comprehensive Guide"! This project aims to create an advanced, comprehensive guide to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for senior software engineers, advanced programmers, and senior security engineers.

## Project Overview

This book is intended to serve as an encyclopedic reference guide to the EVM. We aim to cover everything from the basics to advanced topics, including programming with Solidity and Vyper, understanding smart contracts, security considerations, gas and optimization, interacting with EVM, testing on EVM, deploying and upgrading smart contracts, and much more.
